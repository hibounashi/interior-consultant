In this challenge, I learned about new things in CSS, such as how to use animations. Additionally, I began learning and applying JavaScript on my page. In the end, I hosted my demo using W3Schools as a static website.

It took me some time to grasp new concepts in JavaScript, but it was definitely worth it in the end.
